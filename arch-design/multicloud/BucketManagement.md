# Bucket management in SODA-multicloud


**Author(s)**: [Pravin Ranjan](https://github.com/PravinRanjan10), [Vineela Pachchipulusu](https://github.com/vineela1999)


## Motivation and background

In the cloud world, every cloud vendor provides object storage space to users. Generally in terms of bucket/container and folder. A user can store the data/objects in a specific bucket or folder.

SODA multi-cloud(gelato) is a project which manages multiple cloud vendors from one place. And also interfaces to use cloud services. So it is important for SODA to provide bucket management support for various cloud vendors. So that user can create and manage buckets from one place(SODA multi-cloud).

## Goals
The document provides the use case, design and implementation guidelines for supporting bucket management from SODA platform. It includes creation, deletion, object uploading, migration etc. in various cloud providers.

### Non-Goals
NA

### Requirement Analysis

##### Functional Requirements

##### Bucket Operations

1. Create buckets or/and folders in various cloud providers. Ex: Aws, gcp, azure

2. Delete bucket or/and folder from various cloud providers. Ex: Aws, gcp, azure

3. List all the bucktes

4. Upload objects in bucket or/and folder

5. Download objects from bucket or/and folder

6. Delete object from bucket or/and folder

7. Migration, copy-paste objects, bucket encryption

8. Lifecycle transition rules

##### Tiering Policy

9. Create Tier

10. Update Tier

11. List Tiers

12. Delete Tier


##### Non Functional Requirements

1. The system should be highly available. Multiple users can login to the system and create buckets, folders, upload objects etc.
The design document for this can be referred from [here](https://github.com/SODAfoundation/architecture-analysis/pull/96)

2. The system should work with minimum latency.

3. The system should be scalable and it should handle the high amount of users request.


## Architecture Analysis

The overall multi cloud architecture can be referred from [here](https://github.com/SODAfoundation/architecture-analysis/blob/master/arch-design/multicloud/MultiCloud_Design.md)

### Use case View

For heterogeneous object management, bucket creation is important. Currently SODA-multicloud supports creation of folders under cloud buckets as shown in Fig-1. So, SODA-users must need to create cloud buckets manually and provide a name, AK/SK to SODA for folder creation. As shown in fig-1, step-1 is manual which is performed by the user, whereas step-2,3,4,.. are supported by SODA-multi-cloud.

To avoid manual intervention, step-1 should also be part of SODA-multicloud as shown in Fig-2. This way users need not to do anything manually on the cloud vendors console.

Once the buckets are created, users should perform all the operations supported by SODA-multicloud. For example: Uploading objects, setting lifecycle rules, migration etc.

#### Sequence to Create buckets:

Step-1. Register Backend

  - Name
  - Type: aws/azure/gcp etc
  - Endpoint:
  - Others headers(like AK/SK etc.)

Step-2. Create Tier policy(configuration), May be the Admin Operation

  - Gold:
      - Banackend: "abc"

  - Silver:
      - Banackend: "pqr"

  - Bronze:
      - Banackend: "xyz"

Step-3. Create bucket

  - Name:
  - Backend_name
  - Tier-policy

##### The Diagram to show bucket creation:

Below diagram shows two things:

1. Bucket can be created with Tier policy.

2. The Tier policy of bucket will be taged in SODA-multicloud bucket. But there will be not tagging in actual cloud account.

#### Scratch Pad:
There are thoughts, what could be the Tier policy. Initially we have added just storageClass but other parameters can also be defined, like IOPS, latency etc.

- Gold:
    - storageclass: tier_1(Aws:standard, GCP:hot, Azure:xyz)
    --------
    - IOPS: 10GB
    - latency: 5 ns
    - Size: 20-400 Gbi
    - AccessMode: ReadWriteMany
    --------

- Silver:
  - storageclass: tier_99(Aws:cold, GCP:xxx, Azure:xxx)
  ------

  - IOPS: 5GB
  - latency: 10 ns
  - Size: 20-200 Gbi
  - AccessMode: ReadOnlyMany
  ------

- Bronze:
  - storageclass: tier_999(aws:xxx, GCP:xxx, Azure:xxx)
  -------
  - IOPS: 2GB
  - latency: 15 ns
  - Size: 20-100 Gbi
  - AccessMode: ReadWriteOnce
