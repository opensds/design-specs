## Motivation and background

//Describe why this feature? What is the background to develop this etc....

### Non-Goals

//What will not be addressed by the proposal?

### Assumptions and Constraints

//What are the assumptions/constraints known

  
### Requirement Analysis

### Input Requirements

//What are the input requirements for this feature (can give links to the high level requirements/architecture documents, tasks, analysis etc)

  
### Feature Requirements

#### Requirement Analysis

//Analysis go here

#### List of Requirements

//Give all the requirements identified for the modules, in different categories


##### Functional Requirements

##### Non Functional Requirements

Performance Requirements

Security Requirements

Other Non Functional Requirements (Scalability, HA etc…)

  
## Architecture Analysis

### Module Architecture

//Module Architecture details go here

### High Level Module View

//Give the overall system architecture and provide the positioning of Module in that. Give the external interfaces, brief description etc…

### Architecture Tenets

//Key strategy, principle of Module architecture. Please add all the inputs from system architecture for the module here...like if overall architecture says the external interface from the module must be REST or the module must be a microservice or the module to be deployed as a lib etc…..So please study the system architecture to provide the details for the module architecture inputs in this section

  

### High Level Module Architecture

//Provide your module architecture with key external interfaces and internal blocks….

  

## Detailed Design
//All the detailed design aspects go here

### Use case View

//Provide system context and typical use cases to determine the scope and boundaries for the module.

#### List of Typical Usecases

//Provide a list of typical usecases
 

#### Usecase context model

//How is the module in the overall conext of the usecase..typically for a usecase flow...how the module needs to behave...a network diagram with module could help

#### Interface Model

//What are the interfaces for the Modules needed and the view

External Interfaces

//Provide the details of the interface, type, why ? any limitations or alternates etc…

  
#### End User Context

//Analysis and design inputs for the end user of the module

  

### Functional Context

//Based on the functional requirements, what are the design aspects to be considered. Give all the details and block diagrams etc..

 ### Non Functional Context

//Based on the non functional requirements, what are the design aspects to be considered. Give all the details and block diagrams etc..

 #### Performance

//What are the design considerations for performance

#### Security

//What are the design considerations for security

#### Other Non Functional Aspects
//What are the design considerations for other non functional requirements
 

### Data View

#### Data and Control Data Contexts

//Provide the details on data and control data flow 

#### Data Model

Data Structures, key points considered, open and alternate points etc…All the data structure to be added here

  
### Development and Deployment Context

#### Code

//Provide inputs for code structure, language, any open source code can be resused, coding methods, development env etc

 #### Debug Model

//how to debug the module, specific logging, debug options etc…

  
#### Build & Package

//How this module is built along with other modules etc…What is the package model

  #### Deployment

//How to install and deploy the module in the system, hardware resource requirements etc. Any other network or such requirements..like client or http server needed etc…

  
### Execution View

//During the run time, any specific aspects to be considered...like logging to be done for the module etc..It is not functional logs, it is specific to the module maintenance; OR Runtime replication or any such requirements to be considered during the design

  
## Sequence Diagrams

//Provide the key control and data flow sequence diagrams here

  
## Design Alternatives and other notes

//If you have any other ideas or alternate suggestions or notes which needs further analysis or later consideration, please add here
  

## Open Issues

//All the open issues go here. Please track it else where to closure

  
## Design Requirements / Tasks

//List of detailed tasks for this module go here. Based on all the design and analysis, please list all the tasks to be completed for the implementation and release of the module. If you are updating the overall task list or location, please provide the links or ids here...This is to get an overall consolidation of task items for this module

## Scratchpad

//All raw inputs or discussion points or etc can be added here
