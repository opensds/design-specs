# CSI Plug & Play Requirements & Design

Author(s): [Sushantha](https://github.com/sushanthakumar), [Sanil Kumar](https://github.com/skdwriting),

March 2020, Initial Version and Analysis

## Goals

Provide a plug and play option for standard CSI drivers to SODA On prem data platform

## Motivation and background

1.  All the available CSI drivers for Storage backends can be supported with SODA quickly. (Large storage backend support quickly)
    
2.  Easy management of CSI backends for the user from Kubernetes (Single CSI plugin from SODA can manage huge number of drivers)
    
3.  All the SODA platform features will be available for all those backends (migration, telemetry and all)
    
4.  CSI Drivers are mostly supported by the vendors directly , hence easy production ready solutions for kubernetes on SODA platform
    

### Non-Goals

Do not replace the need for CSI Drivers for kubernetes

No new specification or interface

### Assumptions and Constraints

The current csi flow in SODA is working fine and no performance issues.

## Architecture Analysis

### Current Flow in SODA for CSI

-   SODA CSI Plugin runs along with k8s sidecar containers
    
-   Profile info is the one helps to determine the desire backend

-   SODA CSI Plugin converts CSI calls to SODA API calls

-   All the storage resources provisioned are visible at SODA ecosystem through API Server
    

### Proposed Architecture - High Level

### Architecture Tenets

1.  Does not break the current API, Controller and DOCK interfaces
    
2.  Does not impact on the current API spec
    

### High Level Module Architecture

TBD

## Detailed Design
